Now the **MIT License** text is stored in `LICENSE` file, and the README directly links to it.  

If you want, I can also **generate professional GIFs of your app's drag and delete features** so you can replace those placeholder paths in the README with real visuals. That will make your GitHub page pop.  

Do you want me to prepare that GIF-making guide for you?
